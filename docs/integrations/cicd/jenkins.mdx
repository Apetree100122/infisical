**Objective**: Fetch secrets from Infisical to Jenkins pipelines

In this guide, we'll outline the steps to deliver secrets from Infisical to Jenkins via the Infisical CLI.
At a high level, the Infisical CLI will be executed within your build environment and use a machine identity to authenticate with Infisical.
This token must be added as a Jenkins Credential and then passed to the Infisical CLI as an environment variable, enabling it to access and retrieve secrets within your workflows.

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add secrets to [Infisical](https://app.infisical.com).
- Create a [machine identity](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) (Recommended), or a service token in Infisical.
- You have a working Jenkins installation with the [credentials plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/) installed.
- You have the [Infisical CLI](/cli/overview) installed on your Jenkins executor nodes or container images.

      ## Add Infisical Machine Identity to Jenkins

      After setting up your project in Infisical and installing the Infisical CLI to the environment where your Jenkins builds will run, you will need to add the Infisical Machine Identity to Jenkins.

      To generate a Infisical machine identity, follow the guide [here](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities).
      Once you have generated the token, navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials** in your Jenkins instance.

      ![Jenkins step 1](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_1.png)

      Click on the credential store you want to store the Infisical Machine Identity in. In this case, we're using the default Jenkins global store.

      <Info>
        Each of your projects will have a different `INFISICAL_TOKEN`.
        As a result, it may make sense to spread these out into separate credential domains depending on your use case.
      </Info>

      ![Jenkins step 2](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_2.png)

      Now, click Add Credentials.

      ![Jenkins step 3](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_3.png)

      Choose **Secret text** for the **Kind** option from the dropdown list and enter the Infisical Service Token in the **Secret** field.
      Although the **ID** can be any value, we'll set it to `infisical-machine-identity-client-id` and `infisical-machine-identity-client-secret` for the sake of this guide.
      The description is optional and can be any text you prefer.


      ![Jenkins step 4](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_4_identity_id.png)
      ![Jenkins step 5](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_4_identity_secret.png)

      When you're done, you should see two credentials similar to the one below:

      ## Use Infisical in a Freestyle Project

      To fetch secrets with Infisical in a Freestyle Project job, you'll need to expose the credential you created above as an environment variable to the Infisical CLI.
      To do so, first click **New Item** from the dashboard navigation sidebar:

      ![Jenkins step 6](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_6.png)

      Enter the name of the job, choose the **Freestyle Project** option, and click **OK**.

      ![Jenkins step 7](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_7.png)

      Scroll down to the **Build Environment** section and enable the **Use secret text(s) or file(s)** option. Then click **Add** under the **Bindings** section and choose **Secret text** from the dropdown menu.

      ![Jenkins step 8](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_8.png)

      Enter `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` in the **Variable** field for the client ID, and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` for the client secret. Then click the **Specific credentials** option from the Credentials section and select the credentials you created earlier.
      In this case, we saved it as `Infisical Machine Identity Client ID` and `Infisical Machine Identity Client Secret` so we'll choose those from the dropdown menu.

      Make sure to add bindings for both the client ID and the client secret.

      ![Jenkins step 9](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_9_identity.png)

      Scroll down to the **Build** section and choose **Execute shell** from the **Add build step** menu.

      ![Jenkins step 10](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_10_identity.png)

      In the command field, you can now use the Infisical CLI to fetch secrets.
      The example command below will print the secrets using the service token passed as a credential. When done, click  **Save**.

      ```bash
        export INFISICAL_TOKEN=$(infisical login --method=universal-auth --client-id=$INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID --client-secret=$INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET --silent --plain)
        infisical secrets --env dev --projectId=<your-project-id>
      ```

      ![Jenkins step 11](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_11_identity.png)

      Finally, click **Build Now** from the navigation sidebar to run your new job.

      ## Use Infisical in a Jenkins Pipeline

      To fetch secrets using Infisical in a Pipeline job, you'll need to expose the Jenkins credential you created above as an environment variable.
      To do so, click **New Item** from the dashboard navigation sidebar:

      ![Jenkins step 6](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_6.png)

      Enter the name of the job, choose the **Pipeline** option, and click OK.

      ![Jenkins step 12](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_12.png)

      Scroll down to the **Pipeline** section, paste the following into the **Script** field, and click **Save**.

      ```
      pipeline {
          agent any

          environment {
              MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID = credentials('infisical-machine-identity-client-id')
              MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET = credentials('infisical-machine-identity-client-secret')

          }

          stages {
              stage('Run Infisical') {
                  steps {
                      sh("export INFISICAL_TOKEN=$(infisical login --method=universal-auth --client-id=${MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID} --client-secret=${MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET} --silent --plain)")
                      sh("infisical secrets --env=dev --path=/ --projectId=<your-project-id>")

                      // doesn't work
                      // sh("docker run --rm test-container infisical secrets --projectId=<your-project-id>")

                      // works
                      // sh("docker run -e INFISICAL_TOKEN=${INFISICAL_TOKEN} --rm test-container infisical secrets --env=dev --path=/ --projectId=<your-project-id>")

                      // doesn't work
                      // sh("docker-compose up -d")

                      // works
                      // sh("INFISICAL_TOKEN=${INFISICAL_TOKEN} docker-compose up -d")
                  }
              }
          }
      }

    ## Add Infisical Service Token to Jenkins

    <Warning>

Service tokens are being deprecated in favor of [machine identities](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities).

They will be removed in the future in accordance with the deprecation notice and timeline stated [here](https://infisical.com/blog/deprecating-api-keys).

</Warning>

    After setting up your project in Infisical and installing the Infisical CLI to the environment where your Jenkins builds will run, you will need to add the Infisical Service Token to Jenkins.

    To generate a Infisical service token, follow the guide [here](/documentation/platform/token).
    Once you have generated the token, navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials** in your Jenkins instance.

    ![Jenkins step 1](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_1.png)

    Click on the credential store you want to store the Infisical Service Token in. In this case, we're using the default Jenkins global store.

    Choose **Secret text** for the **Kind** option from the dropdown list and enter the Infisical Service Token in the **Secret** field.
    Although the **ID** can be any value, we'll set it to `infisical-service-token` for the sake of this guide.
    The description is optional and can be any text you prefer.


    ![Jenkins step 4](../../images/integrations/jenkins/jenkins_4.png)

    When you're done, you should see a credential similar to the one below:

The example provided above serves as an initial guide. It shows how Jenkins adds the `INFISICAL_TOKEN` environment variable, which is configured in the pipeline, into the shell for executing commands.
There may be instances where this doesn't work as expected in the context of running Docker commands.
However, the list of working examples should provide some insight into how this can be handled properly.
